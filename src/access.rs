//! Declared system access: what a system reads and writes, and which
//! declared systems could run together.
//!
//! **Status:** declarations, view systems and the conflict rules are in
//! place; systems still run one after another, in phase and registration
//! order. The parallel executor that uses them is planned (#138). The
//! guide's "Declared system access" chapter has the full design.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! A [`SystemAccess`] lists:
//!
//! - **components** read or written (`&T` / `&mut T` in queries, `get`, `get_mut`),
//! - **resources** read or written,
//! - **events** read or sent ([`Events`](crate::Events)),
//! - whether the system records **commands** ([`Commands`](crate::Commands)),
//! - the engine **services** it uses ([`Service`]: input, time, random,
//!   audio, cameras, physics, ...), read or written.
//!
//! Or it is [`exclusive`](SystemAccess::exclusive): it may use anything, and
//! conflicts with every other system. A system registered without a
//! declaration (every `.sim_system(...)`, `.system(...)`, built-in and
//! hot-patched system, and C/C++ systems added without one) is exclusive,
//! so existing games behave exactly as before.
//!
//! # When two declarations conflict
//!
//! Two systems conflict, and so must keep their order, when either is
//! exclusive, or both touch the same component, resource or service and at
//! least one writes it, or events or commands make their order visible.
//! [`SystemAccess::conflicts_with`] is the symmetric, conservative rule;
//! [`SystemAccess::conflicts_before`] the finer one for a known order, under
//! the batch barrier contract it documents. Only systems in the same
//! [`Phase`] are compared: phases are ordered barriers.
//!
//! # Soundness strategy
//!
//! A declaration is a promise; the engine must not trust it blindly.
//!
//! 1. **View systems enforce it.** A system registered with
//!    [`Game::add_view`](crate::Game::add_view) gets a
//!    [`SystemView`](crate::system_view::SystemView) instead of `&mut Ctx`: a restricted
//!    [`WorldView`](crate::WorldView) of its declared components and
//!    resources, and checked access to its events, commands and services,
//!    in every build. Nothing else is reachable, so such a system can't go
//!    beyond its declaration. Only view systems may ever share a parallel
//!    batch ([`AccessReport::parallel_pairs`]).
//! 2. **`Ctx` systems are checked in debug builds.** A system registered
//!    with [`Game::add_with_access`](crate::Game::add_with_access) (or a C
//!    or C++ system with a declaration) keeps `&mut Ctx`. In builds with
//!    debug assertions it runs with access recording on
//!    ([`World::record_access`](crate::World::record_access) and the same
//!    for events); afterwards any component, resource or event it used
//!    without declaring it, any structural change made directly on the world
//!    (spawn, despawn, insert, remove: those need exclusivity or commands),
//!    and any undeclared command panics, naming the system and what it
//!    used. Services aren't recorded. These systems always run sequentially.
//! 3. **No shared `Ctx`, ever.** A parallel executor must never hand
//!    `&mut Ctx` (or `&mut World`) to two systems at once; views share
//!    `&World` under the rules of [`ViewState`](crate::ecs_core::ViewState).
//!
//! # Scope and limits
//!
//! - **Drawing, UI, assets and profiling** ([`Service::Gfx`], `Ui`,
//!   `Assets`, `Perf`) can be declared but aren't offered to view systems;
//!   systems that use them keep `&mut Ctx`.
//! - **Physics** steps and other built-in systems stay exclusive.
//! - **Foreign (C/C++) systems** declare components, resources and events
//!   by registered name and stay sequential.
//! - **Hot patching** swaps a system's code, not its declaration. A patched
//!   view system still can't reach anything undeclared; a patched `Ctx`
//!   system is caught by the debug check on its next run.
//! - Release builds skip the `Ctx` recorder entirely; views check each
//!   accessor call (never per entity) in every build.
//!
