//! Asynchronous asset streaming: an upload queue with a per-frame byte
//! budget, deterministic asset states, and textures that stream in from a
//! small stand-in up to full resolution.
//!
//! [`Ctx::stream_texture`] (and, with the `3d` feature,
//! [`Ctx::stream_mesh`]) never wait: the first call starts decoding the file
//! on a [`Job`](crate::stream::Job) thread and returns `None`; once decoded, the
//! asset is uploaded at the start of a frame, within the
//! [upload budget](crate::Graphics::set_upload_budget). A texture appears first as a
//! stand-in at most 32 pixels a side and doubles in resolution each upload
//! until it is full size or its [residency budget](Ctx::set_residency_budget)
//! is reached. Evicted textures drop back to that stand-in; evicted meshes
//! keep their id for when they come back.
//!
//! Each asset's [`AssetState`] changes only in that upload step, and
//! uploads run in the order the assets were asked for. With
//! [`Graphics::set_deterministic_uploads`](crate::Graphics::set_deterministic_uploads) the step waits for decoding instead of
//! moving on, so which frame each state changes in depends only on the
//! order of requests and the budget: the same run gives the same frames.
//! States are fixed per frame, not per simulation tick (a frame may run
//! several ticks or none). Without it, decodes finish when the workers do:
//! the frame an asset arrives in, and so the order new textures get their
//! ids in, can differ between runs.
