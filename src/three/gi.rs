//! Real-time global illumination: light bounced off surfaces, from a grid
//! of probes around the camera (see [`GlobalIllumination`]).
//!
//! Each frame a few probes look at the world around them: the renderer
//! draws six small views from each (lit as usual, with the probes' light
//! as their ambient light, so light bounces once more with every update)
//! and turns them into how much light reaches the probe from each
//! direction, and how far away the surfaces around it are. Surfaces then
//! take their ambient light from the eight probes around them, each counted
//! only as far as it can see the surface (by those distances), so light
//! doesn't leak through walls.
//!
//! Here: the settings, which probes to update, and what their views draw.
//! The renderer's side is `render/gi.rs`.

/// each time a probe looks again. Inside the grid, surfaces take this light
/// instead of the sky and ground ambient light; toward its edges it fades
