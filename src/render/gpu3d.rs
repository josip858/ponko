//! The 3D passes: instanced meshes with a depth buffer and 4x multisampling,
//! drawn before sprites. Made the first time a game creates a mesh or
//! material.
//!
//! The frame, in order:
//! 0. **sky texture**: with an atmosphere, the sky in every direction;
//! 1. **shadows**: one pass per cascade of the sun's shadow map;
//! 2. **depth prepass**: the nearest depth of every pixel, so the next pass
//!    lights each pixel once, and later passes can read the depth; GTAO and
//!    screen-space reflections (see `screen.rs`, `ssr.rs`) trace it here;
//! 3. **opaque**: lit models into an HDR (16-bit float) target, keeping only
//!    the fragments the prepass found nearest, then the sky behind them and
//!    the transparent models over them;
//! 4. **bloom**: bright light is blurred through a chain of ever smaller
//!    images and back up (skipped when bloom is off);
//! 5. **post**: exposure, bloom, color grading and tone mapping, onto the
//!    screen.
//!
//! With temporal antialiasing, the camera also jitters by a sub-pixel amount
//! each frame, the lit frame goes into its own image, models that moved
//! since the last frame are drawn again for their motion vectors (after the
//! depth prepass, shared with temporal AO), and the post pass starts by resolving the frame with the
//! history into the HDR target (see `taa.rs`).
//!
//! Sprites and UI are drawn on top afterwards, without tone mapping.
