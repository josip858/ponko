//! keep the nearest depth (shadow maps, depth prepasses) or that test
//! against a finished prepass draw the same pixels in any order, so they
//! draw the runs sorted by the state each draw binds: pipeline, then
//! material, then mesh. Neighbouring runs then share pipelines and material
//! bind groups instead of switching back and forth. The transparent pass
//! blends, so it keeps the collected order.
