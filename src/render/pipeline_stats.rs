/// Material shaders are built into a set of pipelines per variant (one-

/// shadow, motion vectors, and the alpha-to-coverage ones with
/// multisampling). The cache keys them by the shader's code, the GPU
/// features it is composed with, the target formats and the sample count:
/// shaders with the same code share one set, a frame that needs a variant
/// not built yet builds it once (a miss, and a hitch inside that frame),
/// and a hot reload replaces only the reloaded shader's sets.
///
/// Counts are totals since the renderer started; times are milliseconds
/// of CPU time spent in the calls that build pipelines (drivers that
/// compile later, on first use, hide part of their cost from it). All zero
/// in headless runs and without the `3d` feature.
