//! The game: rules, input mapping and drawing. Shared with `tests/coin_dash.rs`.
//!
//! Three layers, each a [`Plugin`] and each testable on its own; [`CoinDash`]
//! is the three together:
//!
//! 1. [`Controls`]: `read_input` (frame system) turns keys and gamepad into
//!    an [`Intent`].
//! 2. [`Rules`]: `rules` (sim system) is the whole game. It reads only the
//!    `Intent` and the world, so a test can replace step 1 with a script and
//!    get the same result on every run.
//! 3. [`Drawing`]: entities with a `Sprite` are drawn by the engine's
//!    built-in sprite system; `hud` adds the text. Neither changes the game.
//!
//! The game moves through four [`Screen`]s: `Title` → `Playing` ⇄ `Paused`,
//! `Playing` → `Result` → `Playing` again (or back to `Title`). Only `rules`
//! changes the screen. The best time and most coins are kept in a small
//! [`Progress`] file that survives a missing or damaged file.

// The test file includes this module but needs only part of it.
