//! Change detection: which components were added, changed or removed, and when.
//!
//! It is opt-in per component. A world that tracks nothing keeps no stamps
//! and does no extra work: every hook sits behind one flag per archetype.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! The world counts [`Tick`]s. A tracked component keeps two stamps per
//! entity: the tick it was added and the tick it last changed. A reader
//! remembers the tick it last looked and asks for everything stamped after
//! it, so readers never clear anything and can't hide changes from each other.
//!
//! # What counts as a change
//!
//! | Operation | Added | Changed |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `spawn`, `spawn_batch`, `spawn_at`, `spawn_dynamic`, `spawn_at_dynamic` | yes | yes |
//! | `insert`, `insert_dynamic` of a component the entity lacks | yes | yes |
//! | `insert`, `insert_dynamic` replacing a value | no | yes |
//! | `get_mut` | no | yes |
//! | a query fetching `&mut T` or `Option<&mut T>` | no | yes, every entity it visits |
//! | the same in a `WorldView` query, and its `get_mut` | no | yes |
//! | `for_each_chunk` | no | yes, every requested column of every chunk |
//! | `mark_changed`, `mark_changed_dynamic` | no | yes |
//! | `get`, `has`, `&T` in a query, `count`, `sort_by` | no | no |
//! | `get_dynamic` (a raw pointer) | no | no: call `mark_changed_dynamic` after writing |
//! | `remove`, `remove_dynamic`, `despawn`, `clear`, `reset` | logged as a removal; the entity's other components keep their stamps |
//!
//! A mutable borrow counts as a change whether or not the value is written:
//! the world can't see writes through a `&mut T`, so it assumes one. To
//! change only some entities, read with `&T` and use `get_mut` (or
//! [`Commands`](crate::Commands)) for the ones that need it.
//!
//! Commands are stamped when they are applied, not when they are recorded.
//! Stamps and removal logs aren't saved: restoring a world spawns its
//! entities again, so everything in it counts as added.
