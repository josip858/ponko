# Dependency contracts for reduced engine builds.
#
#   scripts/feature-deps.sh            check every contract below
#   scripts/feature-deps.sh self-test  prove a forbidden dependency fails the check
#   VERBOSE=1 scripts/feature-deps.sh  also print each build's crate list
#
# Each contract resolves one package alone (`cargo tree -p <package>`),
# never the workspace: other members turn engine features on (the C library
# asks for `3d` and `navmesh`, the MCP server's tests for the defaults), and
# Cargo unifies features across every package it builds together. Only normal
# dependencies count, for every target platform, so a contract holds for
# desktop and web builds alike.
#
# A contract lists crates that must NOT be in that build. Adding a crate to a
# reduced build is fine; pulling a whole optional subsystem in is the bug this
# catches. When a contract fails, find the edge with
#   cargo tree -p <package> <features> -e normal --target all -i <crate>
