# Randomness, determinism and saving

A simulation that comes out the same every time it runs with the same
inputs is easy to debug, test and compare: replay a bug, check a balance
change against the old version, let an agent run experiments. Ponko
simulations are reproducible by default.

## Random numbers

Get random numbers in systems from `ctx.random()`:

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
# struct Heading(f32);
fn wander(ctx: &mut Ctx) {
    let random = ctx.random();
    ctx.world.query::<(Entity, &mut Heading)>().par_for_each(|(e, h)| {
        h.0 += random.of(e).range(-0.2, 0.2);
    });
}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:random}}
```

</div>
</div>

- `random.of(entity)` is that entity's own stream for this tick and
  system. It doesn't depend on which thread runs the entity or in what
  order, so it's safe in `par_for_each`.
- `random.stream(n)` is for numbers that don't belong to an entity (where to
  spawn food, which event fires).
- Both give an `Rng` with `f32()`, `range(lo, hi)`, `below(n)`,
  `chance(p)`, `angle()`, `unit_vec2()` and `u64()`.

For setup code and tests, `Rng::new(seed)` makes a generator directly.

C++ has the same generator in the header (`ponko::rng`, `ponko::random`),
bit for bit: a C++ system gets exactly the numbers its Rust twin would.

## Seeds

Every game has a seed, `DEFAULT_SEED` unless you set one:

```rust
Game::new("Colony", 1280, 720).seed(42)
```

Same seed, same simulation. For a different world each run, seed from the
clock.

## What keeps runs the same

The engine guarantees, for a fixed seed:

- systems run in the order they were added, every tick;
- queries visit entities in the same order;
- `par_for_each` gives the same results as a plain loop, as long as each
  entity only writes its own components (the borrow rules make you do that);
- the spatial grid, spatial sorting and commands are deterministic;
- `sim_system_every` and `ctx.turns` depend only on the tick.

The engine's own tests run a simulation with all of these at once
(threads, grid queries, sorting, reduced rates, spawning, despawning)
and check that two runs give byte-identical saves.

Things that break determinism, and what to do instead:

| Don't | Do |
|---|---|
| `rand::thread_rng()`, time-based randomness in systems | `ctx.random()` |
| frame systems (`system`) changing simulation state | do it in a `sim_system` |
| iterating a `HashMap` to decide things | `BTreeMap`, or sort first |
| reading wall-clock time in sim systems | `ctx.time.sim_tick()`, `ctx.time.sim_time()` |

Floating point is deterministic on one machine and build. Across CPU
architectures, transcendental functions (`sin`, `exp`) can differ in the
last bit.

## Saving and loading the world

With [reflection](reflection.md), the whole world saves to JSON:

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
let save = ctx.world.save();            // serde_json::Value
std::fs::write("save.json", save.to_string())?;

let save: ponko::reflect::json::Value = serde_json::from_str(&std::fs::read_to_string("save.json")?)?;
ctx.world.load(&save)?;
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:save}}
```

</div>
</div>

- **Ids are kept.** Loading restores every entity with the id it had, so
  components that refer to other entities (`struct Target(Entity)`) still
  point at the right ones. `Entity` itself saves as its 64-bit id.
- **All or nothing.** `load` checks every component name and value first;
  if anything is wrong, the world is left as it was and you get an error
  saying what.
- **Only reflected components are saved.** The save's `"not_saved"` lists
  the other components by name and count, so nothing goes missing silently.
  Reflected resources are saved too (under `"resources"`); other resources
  and the sim clock aren't. C++ components are saved once
  their fields are described (see [Reflection](reflection.md#c-and-c-components)).

Agents can do the same through `ponko-mcp` (`save_world`, `load_world`):
checkpoint, try something, roll back.
