# Retained game UI

Build a tree once in `ctx.ui`, then update its text, values and styles.
The engine handles layout/input before frame systems and draws the tree above
scene sprites. The retained tree is the game's UI: menus, HUDs, shops, dialogs.
The immediate widgets, `ctx.ui.immediate.panel`, `label` and `button`
([Camera and UI](camera-ui.md#ui)), are for debug overlays and quick prototypes.

In C++ the tree is `ctx.ui_retained()`, a `ponko::ui::tree`; layouts start from
a preset (`ui::fill()`, `ui::row(40)`, `ui::fixed(220, 40)`, `ui::centered(360, 180)`)
or `ui::layout()` and are refined by chaining (`.padding(24).gap(12)`), and
paints are chained too (`ui::paint().wrap()`). In C it is the `ponko_ctx_ui_*`
functions with a flat `PonkoUiLayout` (from `ponko_ui_layout_row`, `_column`,
`_fill`, `_fixed`, `_anchored`, `_centered` or `_default`) and `PonkoUiPaint`
(see [C and C++](c-cpp.md) and below).

The tree is owned by `Ui`, independently of ECS entities. Stable `UiId` handles
identify widgets and events. Removing a subtree invalidates its IDs permanently.
Taffy supplies flexbox, grid, percentage sizes, min/max constraints, padding,
margin, gap and absolute positioning through the `ui_layout` re-export. It owns
neither the renderer nor the event loop. Ponko owns interaction and appearance.

## A shop and inventory grid

The runnable Rust example is `cargo run --example ui_shop`. Build it without
opening a window with `cargo build --example ui_shop`.

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/ui_shop.rs:shop_tree}}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:shop_tree}}
```

</div>
</div>

In Rust, `ui.label(parent, text)`, `ui.title(...)`, `ui.button(...)`, `ui.panel(...)`,
`ui.scroll_area(...)`, `ui.text_input(...)`, `ui.toggle(...)`, `ui.slider(...)`
and `ui.image(...)` add a node and return a builder; chain its layout, text and
paint, and end with `.id()` when you need the id again. `ui.root()` makes a
detached panel to push as a screen. The builders are shorthand for `add_child`
plus the setters, which keep working.

`UiLayout` names the common shapes, so no screen needs its own layout helpers:
`row(height)` and `column(width)` strips, `fill()`, `fixed(w, h)`,
`anchored(x, y, w, h)` in fractions of the parent (of the window for a screen
root), `centered(w, h)` for dialogs and `grid(columns, row_height)` for
inventories, refined with `gap`, `padding`, `grow`, `horizontal`/`vertical` and
`width`/`height`, and placed in points with `top(y)` and `left(x)` (a
centered dialog near the top: `UiLayout::centered(360.0, 180.0).top(180.0)`).
Children stack top to bottom, except in a row. Any Taffy
`ui_layout::Style` is still accepted, and `UiLayout::custom(style)` wraps one.
Give a scroll view a bounded size; `fill()` shrinks to the space its siblings
leave. `UiWidget::Scroll` clips descendants and supports wheel scrolling,
content dragging and a vertical scrollbar. `set_scroll` uses unscaled layout
units and clamps offsets during layout. Nested scroll views intersect clips.
Navigation scrolls the focused widget into view.

Colors and text defaults come from the tree's theme:
`ui.set_theme(UiTheme { panel, control, accent, text, title, text_size, title_size, .. })`.
Every new node takes its `UiPaint` from the theme for its widget, and a title
(`ui.title(parent, text)`) takes the theme's title color and size; paint set on
a node (`.color(..)`, `.size(..)`, `set_paint`) overrides it, and a later
`set_theme` changes only the fields a node didn't set. The screen's theme also
styles the immediate widgets: `set_theme` updates `ctx.ui.immediate.style`
the same way (`UiTheme::style()` is the style it gives them), keeping fields
set there by hand. C++: `tree.theme()`, `tree.set_theme(t)` with a `ui::theme`;
C: `ponko_ctx_ui_theme`, `ponko_ctx_ui_set_theme` with a `PonkoUiTheme`.
`ui.paint(id)` (C++: `resolved_paint(id)`, C: `ponko_ctx_ui_paint`) reads what
a node is drawn with.

### Finding nodes by name

A system that didn't build a screen finds its nodes by name, so no resource
of ids is needed: `.name("shop.buy")` on a builder (or `ui.set_name(id, ..)`)
names a node, and `ui.find("shop.buy")` returns its id; `ui.name(id)` reads it
back. A name belongs to one node of the tree: naming another node the same
moves it, an empty name takes it off, and removing the node frees it. Dotted
names are only a convention. For a screen that reacts only to clicks,
`ui.take_click()` takes the queued events and returns the last clicked node.
C++: `set_name`, `find`, `name`, `take_click` on the tree; C:
`ponko_ctx_ui_set_name`, `ponko_ctx_ui_find`, `ponko_ctx_ui_name`,
`ponko_ctx_ui_take_click`.

`UiPaint` supplies background colors for normal/hover/pressed/disabled states,
borders, font, line height, text color, wrapping and horizontal alignment.
Set `texture` for an image or textured panel, and `slice` to the source border
size in texture pixels for nine-slice backgrounds. `UiWidget::Toggle` uses
zero/one values; `Slider` uses normalized 0..1 values. Read them with `value`
after a `Changed` event. Changes made with setters do not emit user events.

## Named grid areas and repeat tracks

Template areas name rectangular regions. A row is a space-separated list of names;
`.` (or multiple dots) leaves a cell unnamed. All rows must have equal widths and
each name must fill a rectangle. C/C++ rejects invalid templates with a status
message. Names are UTF-8 identifiers using letters, digits, `_` and `-`, without
CSS escapes; reserved CSS keywords and names starting with digits are rejected.

C keeps `PonkoUiTrack` and the original flat track arrays unchanged. For repeats,
use `PonkoUiTemplateTrack` arrays in `grid_template_columns`/`grid_template_rows`;
a nonzero component count overrides the corresponding original track array.
`repetition` is 0 for a single `track`, 1 for `count` repetitions of `tracks`,
2 for auto-fill, or 3 for auto-fit. Repeat fragments cannot contain repeats.
C++ accepts `ui::repeat(3, ui::fr(1))`, multi-track fragments such as
`ui::repeat(2, {ui::track_points(40), ui::fr(1)})`, and
`ui::auto_fill(ui::track_points(100))` / `ui::auto_fit(ui::track_points(100))`.
Automatic repeats require fixed point or percentage tracks throughout the axis
and at most one automatic repeat per axis, following taffy's supported subset.

`column_names({"left", "middle split", "right"})` and `row_names(...)` name
line boundaries. With repeats these are component boundaries, rather than every
expanded track; use `ui::repeat(3, ui::fr(1)).names({"start", "end"})` for names inside
a repeat fragment. Supply exactly one more name set than repeated tracks.
`tree.set_grid_named_line(node, 0, false, "middle", 1)` places a column start at
the first matching line (axis 1 selects rows, `true` selects the end). Negative
occurrences count backwards; zero also resolves implicit area start/end names.
Unknown names follow taffy's implicit-line placement rules. Named spans are
currently Rust-only. Nested repeats are not supported by taffy.

C can use the layout descriptor fields or change existing nodes with
`ponko_ctx_ui_set_grid_template_areas`, `ponko_ctx_ui_set_grid_line_names`,
`ponko_ctx_ui_set_grid_area`, and `ponko_ctx_ui_set_grid_named_line`.
Each takes the same screen or world-panel `target` as other UI calls. Inputs
are copied during the call. Passing zero area/name rows clears those definitions;
an empty area name restores automatic placement. `set_layout` replaces the whole
style, including areas and names. The C layout struct grew, so rebuild native
callers against the regenerated header.

## Screen stack and modal dialogs

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/ui_shop.rs:shop_dialog}}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:shop_dialog}}
```

</div>
</div>

Push a detached root with `push_screen(root, modal)`. All screens render in stack
order; only the top receives input, even when it is not modal. A modal screen
dims earlier screens and owns pointer input outside its rectangle too. Pop with
`pop_screen()`; nodes remain available for reuse. Escape/gamepad East pops the
top screen and emits `ScreenPopped`, consuming the rest of that input snapshot.
The previous screen's focus is restored when possible. Even the last screen can
be popped; game code decides whether to reopen it.

## Events, navigation and ownership

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/ui_shop.rs:shop_events}}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:shop_events}}
```

</div>
</div>

`events()` drains `Clicked`, `Changed`, `Submitted` and `ScreenPopped` events
(C++: `tree.events()` or `tree.next_event()`; C: `ponko_ctx_ui_next_event`, one
tagged `PonkoUiEvent` at a time, `PONKO_NOT_FOUND` when none are left).
Unread events expire at the next UI frame. Event IDs avoid callbacks borrowing
the context and game state simultaneously. Drain events before mutating the tree.

Tab/Shift-Tab traverses enabled controls. Arrows/d-pad use spatial navigation;
Enter, Space or gamepad South activates the focused control. Text inputs reserve
left/right, Home/End, Backspace/Delete, Shift-selection and Ctrl/Cmd-A for editing;
Enter submits. Clicking/dragging selects text. Text is UTF-8 with scalar-boundary
editing; grapheme-cluster editing, clipboard and IME composition are not provided.
Native committed Unicode is available to both UI and games as `ctx.input.typed_text()`.
Custom hosts/tests can supply it through `ctx.input.insert_text()`.

`ctx.ui.wants_pointer()` includes immediate and retained UI, including captured
drags. `ctx.ui.wants_keyboard()` reports retained keyboard/gamepad ownership
while any screen is open. These queries do not erase raw game input: game code
uses them to suppress world actions. UI screen changes cancel pointer capture,
so releasing a dialog button cannot activate an underlying screen.

## Scale and headless tests

Layout and pointer coordinates use logical window units. DPI already belongs
to the window/text renderer; `set_scale(1.25)` adds a user preference on top,
scaling geometry, text and hit testing together. Percentage dimensions resolve
against the available logical viewport, so roots can adapt to resolution.

`Ui::frame(viewport, &UiInput)` runs without a GPU and allows deterministic tests
of layout, events and editing. `Ui::layout` resolves geometry without processing
input. Standalone `Ui` measurements use the built-in font; context-owned UI also
measures loaded custom fonts. The engine keeps existing sprite batching and adds
per-batch scissor rectangles; world sprites and immediate UI remain unclipped.

## Accessibility semantics

`ui.accessibility_tree()` returns a deterministic snapshot of what assistive
technology would read: each shown node's role (group, dialog, label, button,
image, scroll view, text input, checkbox, slider), name, value (text, checked
state or 0..1 range), bounds and states (focusable, focused, disabled, inert,
modal), plus the focused node. Names come from the node's text; give sliders,
text inputs, images and icon-only buttons one with `.accessible_name("Volume")`
or `ui.set_accessible_name(id, "Volume")`. Text inputs expose their text as the
value, never as the name. Names never change layout, focus or events.

Nodes with `display: none` are left out with their subtrees. A modal screen
hides every screen below it; lower screens under a non-modal one stay readable
but inert. The snapshot prints one indented line per node, which suits golden
tests:

```rust
let mut ui = ponko::ui::Ui::default();
let root = ui.root().layout(ponko::ui::UiLayout::fill()).id();
ui.button(root, "Play");
ui.slider(root).layout(ponko::ui::UiLayout::row(20.0)).value(0.25).accessible_name("Volume");
ui.push_screen(root, false);
ui.layout(vec2(800.0, 600.0));
assert_eq!(
    ui.accessibility_tree().to_string(),
    "group\n  button \"Play\" focusable\n  slider \"Volume\" value=0.25 focusable\n"
);
```

This is the platform-neutral half only: no screen reader reads it yet. A native
adapter is planned, and the C/C++ API does not expose these semantics yet
(Rust only for now; the same example is a doctest on `UiAccessTree`).

## UI on surfaces in the world

A computer screen, a shop terminal or a sign with buttons is a `UiPanel3D`: a
component with its own `Ui` that the engine draws every frame into a render
target, which a glowing, alpha-blended quad shows. Build `panel.ui` just like the
screen's tree; its widgets are laid out in the target's pixels, so a 600 x 400
panel has a 600 x 400 viewport. `ctx.gfx.create_ui_panel(width, height, size)` makes
the render target, the material and the quad (`size` is in meters, in the
entity's XY plane, facing +Z) and returns the panel and the `Model` to spawn
with it, next to a `Transform3D`. The quad is an ordinary model: move and
rotate the entity as usual.

In C++ the entity comes first: `ctx.gfx.create_ui_panel(entity, width, height, size)`
gives it the panel and the model, and `ctx.panel_ui(entity)` is the panel's
`ui::tree`, with every call of the screen's tree.

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/ui_panel.rs:panel_create}}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:panel_create}}
```

</div>
</div>

The mouse uses the nearest panel the camera ray through it hits, at the pixel
it hits, unless the screen's own UI wants the pointer. Clicking a panel also
gives it the keyboard (typing, Tab, Enter) until another is clicked; the others
only see the pointer. `panel.pointer()` is where the aim is on it this frame, in
its pixels (`None` when it is off the panel), and `panel.interactive = false`
turns its input off. Events, focus and the screen stack belong to each panel's
own `Ui`: read them from it.

When the cursor is locked (a first-person game) or the aim isn't the mouse (a
controller in VR), give panels a ray yourself with `ctx.ui.set_pointer_ray`,
for example from the camera along its forward direction. `None` goes back to the
mouse.

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
{{#include ../../examples/ui_panel.rs:panel_events}}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:panel_events}}
```

</div>
</div>

Panels are drawn in a pass of their own before the 3D frame that shows them, so
the quad is never a frame behind its contents. Headless runs build and lay out
panels (and `Ui::frame` drives them by hand, like the screen's tree) but draw
nothing and give them no mouse.

## From C

The C API mirrors the Rust one function by function. Nodes are `uint64_t` ids
(`PONKO_UI_NONE` for "no node"); a removed node's id fails with
`PONKO_NOT_FOUND` instead of panicking, and a call that fails changes nothing.

```c
PonkoUiLayout column = ponko_ui_layout_default();
column.flex_direction = PONKO_UI_FLEX_COLUMN;
column.width = (PonkoUiLength){PONKO_UI_LENGTH_PERCENT, 1.0f};
column.padding.top = column.padding.right = column.padding.bottom = column.padding.left =
    (PonkoUiLength){PONKO_UI_LENGTH_POINTS, 24.0f};

uint64_t root, buy;
ponko_ctx_ui_add_panel(ctx, PONKO_UI_SCREEN, PONKO_UI_NONE, &column, &root);
ponko_ctx_ui_add_button(ctx, PONKO_UI_SCREEN, root, "Buy", NULL, &buy); /* NULL layout: default */
ponko_ctx_ui_push_screen(ctx, PONKO_UI_SCREEN, root, false);

PonkoUiEvent event;
while (ponko_ctx_ui_next_event(ctx, PONKO_UI_SCREEN, &event) == PONKO_OK)
    if (event.kind == PONKO_UI_EVENT_CLICKED && event.id == buy) { /* ... */ }
```

Retained tree operations take a `target` after the context: `PONKO_UI_SCREEN`
for the screen's own UI, or the entity of a world-space panel to build and read
that panel's UI with the same calls. Node ids are local to the UI that made them;
the same numeric id can exist in several trees. `ponko_ctx_ui_insert_text` and
`ponko_ctx_ui_wants_keyboard` operate on context-wide input and have no target.
Panels are made with `ponko_ctx_create_ui_panel(ctx, entity, width, height, size, &texture)`,
which gives the entity (it needs a `PonkoTransform3D`) the panel and its model;
`ponko_ctx_ui_panel_pointer`, `ponko_ctx_set_ui_panel_interactive`,
`ponko_ctx_remove_ui_panel`, `ponko_ctx_set_ui_pointer_ray` and
`ponko_ctx_clear_ui_pointer_ray` do the rest.

```c
PonkoTexture texture;
ponko_ctx_create_ui_panel(ctx, terminal, 600, 400, (PonkoVec2){1.2f, 0.8f}, &texture);
uint64_t buy;
ponko_ctx_ui_add_button(ctx, terminal, PONKO_UI_NONE, "Buy", NULL, &buy);
ponko_ctx_ui_push_screen(ctx, terminal, buy, false);
```

`PonkoUiLayout` is the Taffy `Style` flattened: display, position, flex
direction, wrap, grow, shrink and basis, the alignment properties, width, height,
min/max sizes, margin, padding, inset, gap, aspect ratio, grid tracks (arrays with
a count, read only during the call) and grid item placement. Lengths are a kind
(automatic, points or a fraction of the parent) and a value. Enum-valued fields
are `uint32_t` holding the constants of the matching `PonkoUi*` enum, and an
unknown value is an error. `PonkoUiPaint` is `UiPaint`; fonts come from
`ponko_ctx_load_font`. Text is read back into a buffer you size with
`ponko_ctx_ui_text` (call once with capacity 0 for the length).

`ponko_ctx_ui_frame` runs a frame by hand with a `PonkoUiInput`, like
`Ui::frame`, which is how the C and C++ tests click buttons without a window.

This chapter's Rust and C++ examples build the same shop: the C++ one is
`examples/cpp/guide.cpp`, compiled and run headless in CI.
