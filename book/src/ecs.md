# Entities, components, queries

The game world lives in `ctx.world`, an entity-component system (ECS).

- An **entity** is an id (`Entity`). It has no data of its own.
- A **component** is any `Send + Sync + 'static` Rust type. No derive needed.
  In C++ it is any plain struct (trivially copyable), found by its type:
  nothing to register.
- A **query** visits every entity that has a given set of components.

## Spawning

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
struct Health(f32);
struct Enemy;

let e: Entity = ctx.world.spawn((Transform2D::at(vec2(10.0, 20.0)), Health(100.0), Enemy));

// Many at once is much faster than a loop of `spawn`:
ctx.world.spawn_batch((0..100_000).map(|i| (Transform2D::at(vec2(i as f32, 0.0)), Health(10.0))));
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:ecs_spawn}}
```

</div>
</div>

A tuple of components is a *bundle*; bundles go up to 12 components. C++
passes the components straight to `spawn`.

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:ecs_components}}
```

## Reading and changing one entity

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
# struct Health(f32);
# struct Enemy;
# let e = ctx.world.spawn((Health(10.0), Enemy));
if let Some(h) = ctx.world.get_mut::<Health>(e) {
    h.0 -= 5.0;
}
ctx.world.insert(e, Enemy);        // add or replace a component
ctx.world.remove::<Enemy>(e);      // returns the removed value
ctx.world.despawn(e);
assert!(!ctx.world.is_alive(e));   // old handles stay dead, even if the slot is reused
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:ecs_one}}
```

</div>
</div>

## Queries

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
# struct Health(f32);
# struct Enemy;
ctx.world
    .query::<(&mut Transform2D, &Health)>()
    .without::<Enemy>()
    .for_each(|(t, h)| t.position.y += h.0);
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:ecs_query}}
```

</div>
</div>

In C++, `each` reads the components to visit from your function's
parameters: `T&` to change one, `const T&` to read it, and a first
`ponko::entity` parameter gets the entity's id. `world.each_par` is the C++
`par_for_each`: your function runs on all cores at once, so it must only
touch its own entity.

For code that works on whole arrays, `world.query<A, B>(fn)` hands you one
*chunk* (archetype) at a time, with an array per component:

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:ecs_columns}}
```

`each` compiles to the same loop, so it's as fast. With `query_par`, size a
buffer with `world.count<A, B>()` and write row `i` of a chunk to slot
`chunk.first() + i` to fill it from all cores: rows are numbered the same
way in every query.

What you can ask for (Rust):

| In the query | You get |
|---|---|
| `&T` | read access to `T` (entity must have it) |
| `&mut T` | write access to `T` |
| `Option<&T>`, `Option<&mut T>` | the component if present; doesn't filter |
| `Entity` | the entity's id |
| a tuple of the above | all of them, up to 12 (nest tuples for more) |

Filters `with::<T>()` and `without::<T>()` narrow the match without fetching
data. For "either" matches, or a filter you reuse across systems, pass a typed
filter to `filter::<F>()`: `With<T>`, `Without<T>`, `Or<(...)>`, or a tuple of
them that must all hold:

```rust
# struct Player;
# struct Enemy;
# struct Dead;
# struct Health(f32);
type Living = (Or<(With<Player>, With<Enemy>)>, Without<Dead>);
world.query::<&mut Health>().filter::<Living>().for_each(|h| h.0 -= 1.0);
```

Asking for the same component twice with `&mut` (or `Option<&mut T>`) panics.

Ways to run a query:

- `for_each(f)`: the fastest loop; use this by default.
- `par_for_each(f)`: same, split over all CPU cores. Use it for per-entity
  work on many entities.
- `par_collect_into(&mut vec, f)`: fills `vec` with `f` of every match, on
  all cores, in `for_each` order. The vector keeps its memory, so doing it
  every tick allocates nothing.
- `iter()`: a normal iterator, for when you need `map`/`filter`/`collect`. It
  is several times slower than `for_each` on big worlds.
- `count()`, `get(entity)`.

## Commands: changing the world while you iterate

You can't spawn or despawn inside a query loop, because the query is borrowing
the world. Record the change in `ctx.commands` instead:

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
# struct Health(f32);
fn die(ctx: &mut Ctx) {
    let cmds = &mut ctx.commands;
    ctx.world.query::<(Entity, &Health)>().for_each(|(e, h)| {
        if h.0 <= 0.0 { cmds.despawn(e); }
    });
}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:ecs_commands}}
```

</div>
</div>

The engine applies commands after every system, so the next system sees them.

## Resources

A resource is one global value of a type, stored in the world and found
by its type:

<div class="lang-pair">
<div>

```rust
struct Score(u32);
ctx.world.insert_resource(Score(0));
ctx.world.resource_mut::<Score>().0 += 1;
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp
{{#include ../../examples/cpp/guide.cpp:resources}}
```

</div>
</div>

C++ resources are plain structs, copied in and out: `resource<T>()` (throws
if the world has none), `try_resource<T>()`, `set_resource(value)` and
`remove_resource<T>()`. Read them before an `each` loop, not inside it (the
world is borrowed while the loop runs). In C: `ponko_resource_set`,
`ponko_resource_get` and `ponko_resource_remove`, by name.

## Borrowing several things at once

A query borrows the whole world while it loops, and so does `resource_mut`.
You don't need to copy values out first, take a resource out and put it
back, or collect entities to change them after the loop. Say up front what
else the code needs, and the world hands it over together. These calls are
checked once, when the borrow is made, and none of them allocates.

**Resources inside a query loop.** `with_resources` carries resources into
the loop: `&T` to read one, `&mut T` to change it, or a tuple of those.

```rust
# struct Speed(f32);
# struct Score(u32);
# ctx.world.insert_resource(Speed(2.0));
# ctx.world.insert_resource(Score(0));
ctx.world
    .query::<&mut Transform2D>()
    .with_resources::<(&Speed, &mut Score)>()
    .for_each(|t, (speed, score)| {
        t.position.x += speed.0;
        score.0 += 1;
    });
```

**Several resources together.** `resources_mut` gives one `&mut` per type
of a tuple (up to 8 different types):

```rust
# struct Menu(Vec<String>);
# struct Session(String);
# ctx.world.insert_resource(Menu(Vec::new()));
# ctx.world.insert_resource(Session(String::new()));
let (menu, session) = ctx.world.resources_mut::<(Menu, Session)>();
menu.0.push(session.0.clone());
```

**A resource and the rest of the world.** `resource_scope` hands you one
resource and the world next to it, for code that queries, spawns or reads
other resources while it changes that one:

```rust
struct Total(u32);
ctx.world.insert_resource(Total(0));
ctx.world.resource_scope::<Total, _>(|world, total| {
    world.query::<&u32>().for_each(|value| total.0 += *value);
});
```

Inside the scope the resource is not in the world (looking it up finds
nothing). It is back, with your changes, when the scope ends, also on an
early return or a panic. Scopes for different resources can be nested.

**Other entities inside a query loop.** `with_lookup` gives the loop a way
to reach entities by handle: `get` reads, `get_mut` changes. Write what to
fetch from them like a query:

```rust
# struct Health(f32);
struct Bullet {
    target: Entity,
    damage: f32,
}

ctx.world
    .query::<&Bullet>()
    .with_lookup::<&mut Health>()
    .for_each(|bullet, others| {
        if let Some(health) = others.get_mut(bullet.target) {
            health.0 -= bullet.damage;
        }
    });
```

The lookup may read what the query reads (follow a leader's `Transform2D`
while writing your own `Velocity`). It can't touch a component the query
writes, or write one the query reads: that would be two references to one
value, and it panics when the query is built. A lookup ignores the query's
filters.

**A few entities together.** `get_many_mut` borrows the same component of
several entities, for work on a pair that needs both sides. It returns
`None` if one of them is dead or lacks the component, or if you name the
same entity twice:

```rust
# struct Health(f32);
# let a = ctx.world.spawn((Health(1.0),));
# let b = ctx.world.spawn((Health(2.0),));
if let Some([a, b]) = ctx.world.get_many_mut::<Health, 2>([a, b]) {
    std::mem::swap(&mut a.0, &mut b.0);
}
```

| You need | Use |
|---|---|
| a resource in a query loop | `query.with_resources::<(&A, &mut B)>()` |
| several resources | `world.resources_mut::<(A, B)>()` |
| one resource and the whole world | `world.resource_scope::<A, _>(\|world, a\| ...)` |
| another entity in a query loop | `query.with_lookup::<&mut T>()` |
| the same component of a few entities | `world.get_many_mut::<T, N>([a, b])` |
| to spawn, despawn, add or remove in a loop | `ctx.commands` (above) |

These are Rust calls. C and C++ work on whole columns and copy resources in
and out, so they keep their existing calls (see [C and C++](c-cpp.md)).

## Sorting for cache locality

`world.sort_by::<T>(key)` reorders entities that have `T` by a `u64` key.
Entity ids stay valid. The built-in spatial grid uses it to keep entities
that are close in space close in memory; see [Spatial queries](spatial.md).
